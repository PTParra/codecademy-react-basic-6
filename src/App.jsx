/*
  Styling Rock, Paper, Scissors

  In this project, you will get the chance to practice styling React applications using different techniques.

  You will be styling a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. However, rather than sticking to one technique, you will 
  be asked to modify its appearance using inline styling syntax, object variable syntax, and, finally, CSS modules!
